# URHome (WIP)

A little service intended to drive the Arduino (compatible) UNO board and relays to control the 2.4G remote of my lights. 
It takes advantages from [Johnny Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) and serves a http interface so that it should play nicely with [HomeBrigde](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) and http extensions.
